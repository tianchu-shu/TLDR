# TL;DR
TL;DR is a common example for text analysis in ML. Find an article that mentions UIC on the web and write an application that produces a coherent summary in 4-5 sentences.


## Instructions for running project

Install libraries if needed: boilerpy3, re, gensim, nltk, bs4, 

The jupyter notebook contains several sections, the first few sections just 
showing my thought process of doing this task.
The last section <Final function> is where the final version of the task. 
Simply run the function by pasting a url (in quotes)of the article
you want to see the summarization.
e.g. tldr("https://....")

If enter nothing, the function tldr() will summarize the sample url
The result is a coherent summary in 4-5 sentences generated by gensim library.


The function tldr() is also written seperately in the util.py file for code clean purpose.
